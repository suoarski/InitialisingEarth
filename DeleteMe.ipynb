    "It is reccomended that these notebooks are run within a docker container. To do so, first download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/). Once installed, open CMD (for windows) and pull the earthinit image by running the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker pull suoarski/earthinit\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the image has been pulled, clone a copy of the [InitialisingEarth Github](https://github.com/suoarski/InitialisingEarth) repository to some directory on your computer. Then, open Docker Desktop, under *Images* run the newly created docker image named *suoarski/earthinit* as follows:\n",
