For each $N$ closest plate boundary points, we want to calculate the angle $\\theta$ between the direction of plate collision, and direction from plate boundary to a vertex on a plate. Bellow is a function that returns the direction to N nearest boundary locations for each vertex on a plate. Similarly to the distance calculations, our calculations will be split into three different cases. In case 1 and 2, we get the directions from either boundary lines to the vertex, and in case 3, this direction is perpendicular to the boundary line."
