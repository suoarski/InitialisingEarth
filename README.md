# InitialisingEarth

Tectonic Plates simulation of earth as part of my research project.

The main code is store in InitialisingEarth.py and can be run directly from there, or from BatchRunSimulation.py for running batches of the code.

Once at least one simulation has run, we can view the results using DisplayOutput.py, or animate the results with AnimateOutputData.py
