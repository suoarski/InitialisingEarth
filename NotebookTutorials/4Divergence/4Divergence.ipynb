Although I have made attempts at solving this issue in the past, I feel like erosion processes is what I should be using. I should modify the Gospl notebook so that a new gospl simulation is run after each tectonic earth simulation iteration, and see if the Gospl errosion algorithm prevents my mountains from growing too high."
