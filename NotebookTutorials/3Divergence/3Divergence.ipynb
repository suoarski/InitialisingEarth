    "Once we have initialized the ocean floors and their corresponding age, we now wish to simulate the change in height over time. Taking the derivative of the above equation with respect to time for $t \\in [0, 75]$ Mya, we get the change in height $dh$ given a change in time $dt$ as:\n",

    "\n",
    "Since most of the code for interpolating the ocean floor age is similar to that of interpolating heights after moving tectonic plates, we will redefine the remesh algorithm in such a way so that we can more easily add more scalars (Eg. Heights or ocean floor age) to be remeshed later on.\n",

    "As discussed in tutorial 1, we begin by moving the tectonic plates along the sphere, convert the sphere into cylinder to help identify regions of overlapping plates through clustering means. These clusters will now be stored as a class attribute so that we can re-use them to interpolate any scalar field that moves along with the plates (such as height, ocean age, crust thickness...). The code bellow does this clustering, and provides a visualization of the clusters."
