# Initialising Earth
A series of jupyter notebooks demonstrating python code for procedural earth surface dynamics with a particular focus on tectonic plates. This is still a work in progress and changes will be made regularly.

The notebooks can be run within the following docker container, which makes the installation of required libraries much easier.

```
docker pull geodels/gospl
```
